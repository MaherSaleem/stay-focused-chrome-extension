## Introduction
Stay focused is an open source chrome extension 
to help you to block distraction websites like social media.

It's built using VueJs framework.

The idea behinds this, that sometimes you are working, and suddenly you
find yourself setting on social media like Facebook, and you 
spend there like 30 minutes without noticing that.
So this chrome extension will show an image to remind you to back to work.

Moreover, it has locking mechanisms to make disabling the tool needs some
 time, so you will prefer to continue working instead of disabling it

## Installation
