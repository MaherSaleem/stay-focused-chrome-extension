## Introduction

Stay Focused is an open-source Chrome extension designed to help you block distracting websites, such as social media. Built using the Vue.js framework, its purpose is to enhance productivity by keeping you on task.

The extension works by displaying a reminder image when you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through sites like Facebook, often for longer than intended. Additionally, it includes locking mechanisms that make it harder to disable the extension quickly, encouraging you to stay focused rather than turn it off.

## Installation

You can download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stay-focused/nnlgodiccogbpcfnhmclaicljjgfmekd).

## Features

* Block websites using three methods:
  * **By Website**: Block specific websites.
  * **By Word**: Block websites containing certain words.
  * **By Regex**: Block websites using regular expressions.
* Group websites into categories (e.g., Social Media, Videos) for easier management.
* Display motivational images to remind you to refocus.
* Set working hours to block websites only during your specified work times.
* Lock mechanisms to prevent immediate deactivation:
  * **Password Lock**: Requires a password to access settings or disable the extension.
  * **Question Lock**: Requires answering a question to disable the extension.
